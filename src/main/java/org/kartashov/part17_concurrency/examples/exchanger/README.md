###Exchanger

represents a kind of rendezvous point where two threads can exchange objects

Exchanger is a communication mechanism. It lets you pass an object from thread T1 to T2 and at the same time pass back an object from T2 to T1. The swapping is blocking so you can use it as a synchronization mechanism as well
