#Using Streams

##Stream

A stream in Java is a sequence of data

## Stream Pipeline

A stream pipeline is the operations that run on a stream to produce a result.

##Stream Operations:

1. Source: Where the stream comes from.

2. Intermediate operations: Transforms the stream into another one. 
There can be as few or as many intermediate operations as youâ€™d like. 
Since streams use lazy evaluation, the intermediate operations do 
not run until the terminal operation runs.

3. Terminal operation: Actually produces a result. Since streams can 
be used only once, the stream is no longer valid after a terminal 
operation completes.

Primitive Streams:

1. IntStream: used for primitive types int, short, byte, char
2. LongStream: used for the primitive type long
3. DoubleStream: used for the primitive types double and float
