An array is an area of memory on the heap with space 
for a designated number of elements

Scenario                                    Result
Target element found in sorted array        Index of match
Target element not found in sorted array    Negative value showing one smaller than 
                                            the negative of index, where a match needs 
                                            to be inserted to preserve sorted order
Unsorted array                              A surprise—this result isn’t predictable
